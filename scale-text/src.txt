On translations, from big to small, from analog to digital, and vice versa. 
This worksession focuses on mediation, translation and communication.  
Meeting computer tools and formats implies to know the extent, the  weight 
and scale of these otherwise virtual entities. At the translation between 
analog gesture and digital format the notion of scale becomes pertinent. 
Going  from digital to analog, we are used to seeing a discrete logic of 
blobs  as produced by the print head of the inkjet printer. But 1980s 
technology of plotting tables shows that a printer can also be commanded 
in a much more gestural and continuous style.  From a small scale to a 
large scale and from large to small, what tools  can we use for this 
translation? What is lost in the scaling? Can we measure the approximation, 
the distance between instructions and graphical interpretation?
